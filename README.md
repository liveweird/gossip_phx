# Goal

The whole idea of Gossip is to illustrate several ideas in practice.

What ideas?
* how to split functionality into bounded contexts?
* how to build aggregates?
* how to create domain events?
* how to build CQRS?
* how to deal with cross-aggregate operations?

What does it mean "in practice"?
* based on a sort-of-real application

So in the end, we'll be building a Slack clone ...
